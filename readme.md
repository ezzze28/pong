# Overview

For this project, I developed a simple Pong game in order to enhance my understanding of game development concepts and improve my coding skills. The game is a classic two-player Pong-style game where the player and CPU control paddles and try to score points by bouncing a ball past the opponent. This project gave me the opportunity to learn about user input handling, collision detection, game physics, and the basics of UI updates.

### How to Play
The game is played between two paddles, one controlled by the player and the other by the CPU. The player can move their paddle up or down using the arrow keys. The goal is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to get it past the opponent's paddle. Each time the ball crosses one of the score areas, the opponent gains a point, and the ball is reset to the center.

### Purpose
The purpose of writing this software was to apply and deepen my knowledge of game programming. By creating this Pong game, I was able to practice using game engines, handling real-time input, implementing game mechanics, and structuring a simple game project. Additionally, this project helped me explore how to implement basic AI (for the CPU paddle) and improve my understanding of game logic.

# Development Environment

I used Godot, a popular open-source game engine, to develop this Pong game. It provides a user-friendly interface and allows for quick iteration when developing 2D games. The programming language used for scripting is GDScript, which is similar to Python and well-suited for game development within Godot. I also utilized the engineâ€™s built-in nodes and features like collision detection, timers, and input handling to streamline development.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to improve and expand the game by adding the following features:
* Add sound effects and background music to enhance the player experience.
* Implement a scoring system with a win condition, such as the first player to reach 5 points.
* Improve the AI for the CPU paddle to make it more challenging.
* Add a menu system to allow players to start a new game, change settings, and view instructions.
* Implement multiplayer support over a network for playing with friends remotely.
